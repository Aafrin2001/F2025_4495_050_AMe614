HEALTH COMPANION - 15 MINUTE PRESENTATION SCRIPT WITH CODE REFERENCES

[00:00-00:30] INTRODUCTION
Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'm excited to present Health Companion, a comprehensive health management application designed to help seniors manage their health and enable caregivers to monitor their well-being. This project addresses a critical need in our aging population - providing accessible, user-friendly tools for health management.

[00:30-01:30] PROBLEM STATEMENT
As our population ages, managing health becomes increasingly complex. Seniors face challenges tracking medications, monitoring vital signs, scheduling appointments, and maintaining communication with family members and healthcare providers. Traditional healthcare apps are often too complex, difficult to navigate, or lack the features needed for comprehensive health management. Caregivers, whether family members or professionals, struggle to stay informed about their loved ones' health status in real-time.

Health Companion solves these problems by providing an intuitive, accessible platform that combines medication management, health monitoring, activity tracking, and caregiver communication - all in one place.

[01:30-03:30] CORE FEATURES - SENIOR PERSPECTIVE
Let me walk you through the key features from the senior user's perspective.

First, we have Medication Management. Users can add medications with detailed information including dosage, frequency, and special instructions. Looking at MedicationScreen.tsx, lines 163-248, we implemented a comprehensive medication creation flow. The form validation at lines 165-188 ensures all required fields are filled, and the medication is saved using our MedicationService at line 226. The system tracks daily medication schedules, sends reminders, and allows users to mark medications as taken. There's a special "Today's Schedule" view that shows all medications due for the current day, implemented at lines 904-921, making it easy to stay on track. The system supports both daily medications with specific times and PRN - as-needed medications, which you can see in the Daily/PRN toggle selector at lines 1098-1141.

Next is Health Monitoring. The app allows users to record vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, oxygen levels, weight, and blood sugar. In HealthMonitoringScreen.tsx, we implemented a unique grouped input system starting at line 196. Related metrics like blood pressure and heart rate can be entered together, making the process faster and more intuitive. The grouped input functionality is handled in the handleGroupPress function at lines 344-367, and the save logic for multiple metrics at once is in handleSaveGroup at lines 375-401. The system tracks trends over time and displays the last updated date for each metric, which is updated in the updateVitalSignsWithData function at lines 172-193.

Activity Tracking is another key feature. In ActivitiesScreen.tsx, we implemented a comprehensive activity management system. The activity list is rendered starting at line 356, with each activity card showing completion status, duration, and points. The handleActivityPress function at lines 150-173 routes users to specific activity screens like walking, stretching, or breathing exercises. Users can also add custom activities through the modal at lines 372-450, with form validation at lines 200-221. The app calculates calories burned and distance traveled based on activity type and duration. There's even a walking tracker that counts steps.

We also have a Schedule Check feature that helps users manage important health-related appointments and tasks, categorized as doctor visits, medication checks, vitals monitoring, or exercise reminders.

[03:30-05:00] CAREGIVER FEATURES
One of the most innovative aspects of Health Companion is our caregiver functionality. Family members or professional caregivers can request access to monitor a senior's health information. 

In CaregiverDashboardScreen.tsx, the caregiver connection flow starts at line 80 with the handleAddSenior function. The system includes a vetting process - caregivers must provide the senior's email address, shown in the modal at lines 173-236. The backend implementation in CaregiverService.ts handles the access request at lines 22-79, generating a verification code at line 34 and creating a pending relationship record.

The senior must approve the connection using a verification code. This approval process is implemented in CaregiverApprovalScreen.tsx, where seniors can view pending requests and approve or reject them. The CaregiverService.approveRequest method at lines 84-120 handles the approval logic, updating the relationship status to 'approved' and linking the senior's user ID.

Once approved, caregivers have access to a dedicated dashboard showing critical alerts, medication schedules, health metrics, and activity summaries for the senior they're monitoring. The CaregiverDashboardScreen displays feature cards at lines 298-359, allowing caregivers to view alerts, dashboard, medications, and monitoring data. Importantly, caregivers can also edit information on behalf of the senior, which is helpful for seniors who may have difficulty using technology. This is implemented by passing the seniorUserId parameter to screens like MedicationScreen, which accepts an optional userId prop at line 27.

The caregiver dashboard highlights critical health alerts prominently, making it easy to identify when immediate attention is needed. This real-time monitoring capability gives families peace of mind and enables proactive healthcare management.

[05:00-06:30] TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
Let me discuss the technical implementation. Health Companion is built using React Native for the mobile application, providing native performance on both iOS and Android platforms. We've also created a fully responsive web version using React with TypeScript, ensuring the application works seamlessly across all devices.

The backend uses Supabase, which provides authentication, real-time database capabilities, and secure data storage. Our Supabase client is initialized in src/lib/supabase.ts. We've implemented Row Level Security policies to ensure that caregivers can only access data for seniors they're authorized to monitor, while seniors can only access their own data.

The database schema includes tables for medications, health metrics, activities, scheduled checks, and caregiver relationships. The caregiver relationships table tracks the status of access requests - pending, approved, or rejected - maintaining a complete audit trail. This is defined in the CaregiverRelationship interface at lines 3-15 of caregiverService.ts.

For medication management, the MedicationService class in src/lib/medicationService.ts handles all database operations. The saveMedication method at lines 8-37 inserts new medications, while getUserMedications at lines 70-100 retrieves medications, with support for caregivers viewing senior data through the optional userId parameter.

For the AI chat functionality, we've integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT API, allowing users to ask health-related questions and receive personalized advice based on their health data.

[06:30-08:00] USER INTERFACE & EXPERIENCE
User experience was a primary focus in development. The application features a beautiful gradient design with purple and blue tones, creating a calming, professional appearance. You can see this in the LinearGradient components used throughout, for example in ActivitiesScreen.tsx at lines 311-314, which uses colors ['#667eea', '#764ba2']. All icons use line-style icons from Ionicons for a modern, clean look.

The interface is designed with accessibility in mind. We've implemented font size controls through the FontSizeContext, language selection through LanguageContext, and high contrast mode options. The layout is intuitive - important information is prominently displayed, and navigation is straightforward with clear back buttons and logical screen flows.

For medication scheduling, we've implemented a unique flow where users first create the medication, then set up the schedule in a separate full-screen view. This prevents the modal from being too cluttered and allows the native date and time pickers to work properly. In MedicationScreen.tsx, when a new daily medication is created (lines 224-243), we show a schedule setup modal at lines 726-885. The calendar picker uses native platform components at lines 521-609, providing the best user experience on each device. The time picker is implemented at lines 414-492, showing a scrollable list of 15-minute intervals.

We've also implemented a background activity tracking system. The ActivityTrackingContext manages ongoing activities, and if a user starts tracking an activity and navigates to other screens, the activity continues tracking in the background. A card appears on the home screen showing the active activity with a stop button, ensuring users can easily manage ongoing activities.

[08:00-09:30] ADMIN DASHBOARD & ALERTS
The Admin Dashboard provides comprehensive health insights. In AdminDashboardScreen.tsx, the dashboard loads all data at once using Promise.all at lines 72-86, fetching stats, health trends, medication alerts, emergency alerts, daily activities, and inactivity alerts.

The dashboard displays statistics including total medications, health metrics recorded, activities logged, and overdue items. These stats are rendered in summary cards at lines 564-571, showing walk distance, sleep duration, medication adherence, games played, active status, and critical alerts count.

Critical alerts are generated automatically based on health metric readings. The alert system is implemented in the adminDashboardService, which evaluates health metrics against normal ranges. For example, if blood pressure readings are outside normal ranges, if heart rate is too high or too low, or if temperature indicates fever, the system creates alerts with specific severity levels. 

In AdminDashboardScreen.tsx, emergency alerts are rendered at lines 224-253, with clickable cards that show detailed information. When an alert is tapped, the renderAlertDetails function at lines 255-436 displays a comprehensive modal with health metric details, normal ranges, and actionable recommendations. For blood pressure alerts, the details are formatted at lines 266-281, showing systolic and diastolic values, normal ranges, and specific recommendations.

The alert system is intelligent - it considers recent readings and trends, not just isolated values. This reduces false alarms while ensuring genuine health concerns are flagged immediately. The severity levels are color-coded using the getSeverityColor function at lines 117-125, with Critical alerts in red (#D32F2F), High in bright red (#F44336), Medium in orange (#FF9800), and Low in green (#4CAF50).

[09:30-11:00] MOBILE & WEB VERSIONS
We've developed both mobile and web versions of the application. The mobile app provides a native experience with platform-specific features like native date pickers and haptic feedback. The web version is fully responsive, adapting beautifully to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

The web version includes all the same features as the mobile app, with responsive design that ensures optimal viewing on any device. We've implemented comprehensive breakpoints for tablet and mobile views, ensuring buttons are appropriately sized for touch interaction, text is readable, and layouts flow naturally on smaller screens.

Both versions share the same backend infrastructure, so data is synchronized across platforms. A user can log medication on their phone and view it immediately on the web, or vice versa. The MedicationService and other service classes work identically in both environments, using the same Supabase client.

[11:00-12:30] DATA SECURITY & PRIVACY
Security and privacy are paramount in healthcare applications. We've implemented multiple layers of security:

First, all authentication is handled through Supabase Auth, which provides secure password hashing and session management. The authentication flow is managed in App.tsx, with session checking at lines 42-86 and auth state change listeners at lines 91-120.

Second, Row Level Security policies ensure that users can only access their own data, and caregivers can only access data for seniors who have explicitly approved their access. In MedicationService.getUserMedications at lines 70-100, we check the user ID and use RLS policies to filter results. The service accepts an optional userId parameter specifically for caregivers viewing senior data, which is then validated against the caregiver relationship.

The caregiver relationship system includes a verification code mechanism, ensuring that only authorized individuals can connect to a senior's account. The verification code is generated in CaregiverService.requestAccess at line 34, and must be provided during approval. All data transfers use HTTPS encryption, and sensitive health information is stored securely in the database.

We've also implemented proper error handling and logging throughout the application, which helps identify and address security issues quickly while maintaining user privacy. For example, in MedicationService.saveMedication at lines 8-37, we have comprehensive error handling that catches and logs errors without exposing sensitive information to users.

[12:30-13:30] FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Looking ahead, there are several exciting features we plan to implement:

First, push notifications for medication reminders and critical alerts. Second, integration with wearable devices like Fitbit or Apple Watch for automatic activity and health metric tracking. Third, doctor portal access, allowing healthcare providers to view patient data with proper authorization.

We're also planning to add medication interaction checking, which will alert users if medications they're taking might have dangerous interactions. Additionally, we want to implement a medication refill reminder system that automatically calculates when prescriptions need to be refilled based on dosage and frequency. The foundation for this is already in place - we track refill_date in the medications table, and the AdminDashboardScreen already shows medication alerts for upcoming refills at lines 204-222.

Another planned feature is a family communication hub, where caregivers and seniors can share notes and updates about health status, making coordination easier.

[13:30-14:30] CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
During development, we faced several interesting challenges. One was implementing the caregiver access system while maintaining security. We solved this with the verification code system in CaregiverService.ts and proper RLS policies. The two-step approval process ensures that seniors have full control over who can access their data.

Another challenge was creating a smooth user experience for scheduling medications and checks. The solution was separating the creation process from the scheduling process, using full-screen views instead of nested modals, which allows native date pickers to function properly. In MedicationScreen.tsx, we implemented this by showing the schedule modal as a full-screen view at lines 726-885, rather than nesting it inside the medication creation modal. This approach prevents keyboard and picker conflicts, especially on iOS devices.

We also had to ensure the web version was truly responsive across all device sizes. This required careful CSS planning and testing on multiple screen sizes, resulting in a comprehensive responsive design system.

A technical challenge we overcame was handling the dual-platform nature of the app. The same service classes work in both React Native and React web environments, but we had to ensure platform-specific code (like date pickers) worked correctly. In MedicationScreen.tsx, the renderDatePicker function at lines 521-609 handles this by checking Platform.OS and rendering different picker components for Android and iOS.

[14:30-15:00] CONCLUSION
In conclusion, Health Companion addresses a real-world need by providing seniors with an accessible, comprehensive health management tool while enabling caregivers to stay informed and involved. The combination of medication tracking, health monitoring, activity logging, and caregiver communication creates a complete health management ecosystem.

The dual-platform approach - mobile app and web version - ensures accessibility regardless of a user's preferred device. The focus on security and privacy means users can trust the application with sensitive health information.

Key technical achievements include:
- Robust medication management with schedule tracking (MedicationScreen.tsx, lines 163-248)
- Intelligent health monitoring with grouped input (HealthMonitoringScreen.tsx, lines 344-401)
- Secure caregiver access system (CaregiverService.ts, lines 22-120)
- Comprehensive alert system with detailed recommendations (AdminDashboardScreen.tsx, lines 255-436)
- Seamless cross-platform data synchronization

We believe Health Companion can make a real difference in the lives of seniors and their families, promoting better health outcomes through better organization, monitoring, and communication.

Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
